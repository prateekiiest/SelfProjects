**Prime Factorization** - Have the user enter a number and find all Prime Factors (if there are any) and display them.[[prateekiiest(C)]](https://github.com/prateekiiest/SelfProjects/blob/master/prime.c)

**Find PI to the Nth Digit** - Enter a number and have the program generate PI up to that many decimal places. Keep a limit to how far the program will go.[[prateekiiest(C++)]](https://github.com/prateekiiest/SelfProjects/blob/master/pi.cc)
